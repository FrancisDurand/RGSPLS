Each one of the .ipynb files allows the generation of one of the structures : Set Partitions, Weak Orderings and Paritions in Linearly Ordered Subsets.
The generation is given for a given $n$ and not for $n$ in a linear range. This is therfor an improvement from the classic Boltzmann method.
The algorithms run smoothly up to $n$ of order a few tens of millions, and even up to $10^8$ for the weak orderings and set partitions.
The arbitrary precision part of the algorithm has not been done yet.
